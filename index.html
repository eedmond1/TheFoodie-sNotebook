                <h2>My Journey</h2>
                <p><em>Previous to my creation of this website</em>, I was already cooking mainly for myself during college. 
                I had lived away from many restaurants so whenever I was craving something, I had to cook it from scratch myself.
                During this time, I would create google folders to organize the recipes I had cooked, and would refer to them when
                I needed to recreate them either for myself or for my family and friends. After my college years, I became distant with
                cooking due to the stresses of life. However, as of April 2024 - when I started to get back into coding (hehe, again for
                like the 3rd time since I was really bad at being consistent), I wanted to create a website that would tie in my applications
                of my learning of coding, my interest of cooking, and the graphic design skills that I either learned or wanted to learn. I
                figured this website would be a good way for me to practice and apply these skills besides being a useful tool for me to refer
                to in creating recipes. In addition, who knows? Hehe, maybe if it gets good enough, millions could refer to my site and cook
                my recipes! :) Well, enough talking on my part here, and <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=food+recipes">
                let's get creating!</a></strong> </p>
